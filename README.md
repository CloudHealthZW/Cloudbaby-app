# Cloudbaby-app

A sidenote there is an email linked to the google playstore account, I may have posted the password in the whatsapp group, 
-- ( d3v3l0p3r )
its the same password for the keystore.
Incase you need to reset the password, the acc is linked to George's phone number so should be fine.
However this would mean you may need to generate a new Keystore file for the app's deployment and remove the one in the playstore.

The email is developercloudhealthcare@gmail.com
Name is Developer CloudHealthcare.
